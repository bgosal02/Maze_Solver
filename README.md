# Maze Solver Project Overview
Used recursion to implement backtracking (depth first search) to find and display information about the best paths through a maze. This was completed as a course project, with a provided framework.  

# Problem Description
Text files containing square mazes of various sizes were analyzed to find possible paths. The mazes consisted of asteriks, " * ", to represent impassable barriers, and numbers from 0 to 9 to represent the cost of passing through that position. The program then calculates and prints the total number of possible paths/solutions through the maze, the numeric representation of the shortest path, the numeric respresentation of the least expensive path, and the cost of the least expensive path.
